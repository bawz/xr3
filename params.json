{"name":"Xr3","tagline":"A simple and small script to load pages and views","body":"#XR3\r\n###By Jason Silberman\r\n\r\n####Getting Started\r\nXr3 is a simple way to load `node` elements as pages. It is *very* simple to implement. First:\r\n\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/vendor/xr3.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nWhat we are doing here is just including the `xr3.js` script into our project. We need this script for XR3 to work. Next we need to wait for the page load and then call `xr3.run()`. *Make sure you also have [jQuery](http://jquery.com) loaded.\r\n\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\t\tjQuery(document).ready(function () {\r\n\t\t\txr3.run();\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t</script>\r\n\r\nThat is the all the javascript we need for now, next we move to html.\r\n\r\n####Your HTML\r\nHere is a simple example html template for using XR3.\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li data-page=\".home\" class=\"auto-load\">Home</li>\r\n\t\t<li data-page=\".about\">About</li>\r\n\t\t<li data-page=\".contact\">Contact</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t\r\n\t<div class=\"page home\" data-pg=\"true\">\r\n\t\t<h2>Welcome</h2>\r\n\t\t<p>Welcome to my site.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t<div class=\"page about\" data-pg>\r\n\t\t<h2>About Me</h2>\r\n\t\t<p>Here is a page about me.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t<div class=\"page contact\" data-pg>\r\n\t\t<h2>Contact Me</h2>\r\n\t\t<p>Here is some contact stuff.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\nNow, I know there is a lot of code here but let me explain to you what it does. The first thing we are doing which is within a `ul` element. Basically we are making an unordered list and filling it with three `li` elements. There are two *key* things here: one, see how each thing has a `data-page` attribute? That tells the code which \"page\" to open when the element is clicked. And two, see how that `li` for the home page? See how it has a class `auto-load`? That is important to make sure to load that page first.\r\n\r\nNext we are going to look at those `div` elements. Now each `div` has a class of `.page` and an attribute of `data-pt`. This signals to the code that this should be rendered as a page with XR3. Also each have another class that coordinates with a `li` in the `ul` element. Basiciclly what is happening is when a `li` here is clicked it fins the `data-page` attribute and uses that to target a `.page` element and add a `.load` class.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to note that is ***very*** important remember how the `li` for home had an extra class of `.auto-load`? One more thing to note is that whatever page that relates to, we need to make sure that its `data-pg` attribute must be set to true.","note":"Don't delete this file!
